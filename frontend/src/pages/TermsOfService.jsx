        <h2>Products and pricing</h2>
        <p>
          We do our best to describe and price every product accurately. All
          prices on this site are listed in Ghana cedis (GHS) and may change
          without prior notice. In the rare case a product is listed at an
          incorrect price, we will contact you before processing your order to
          confirm whether you&rsquo;d like to proceed at the correct price.

        <h2>Order acceptance</h2>
        <p>
          Placing an order and completing payment does not automatically
          guarantee availability. If an item you ordered is out of stock or
          otherwise unavailable, we will contact you to arrange a replacement,
          refund, or other resolution.
        </p>

        <h2>Payment</h2>
        <p>
          All payments are processed securely through Paystack. We accept the
          payment methods available through Paystack at checkout, including
          major cards and mobile money. Your order is only confirmed once
          payment has been successfully verified.

        <h2>Delivery</h2>
        <p>
          We deliver within Kumasi and to other locations across Ghana.
          Delivery fees are shown at checkout and vary depending on your
          location. Estimated delivery times may vary depending on your
          location and product availability; we&rsquo;ll keep you informed if
          there are any delays.

        <h2>Returns and refunds</h2>
        <p>
          Our full return and refund terms — including the requirement to
          contact us immediately upon receiving your order if there&rsquo;s an
          issue — are set out in our{" "}
          <a href="/returns">Return &amp; Refund Policy</a>, which forms part of
          these terms.
